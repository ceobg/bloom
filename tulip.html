    <h>TULIPS ARE YELLOW</h>
<br>
<p>I love tulips, but sunflowers are nice too. In my eyes, roses are the best of the best.
    There is no other way to describe them besides, beautiful, lovely and quite frankly, divine.
    Tulips come in many different colors. Although, pink is my favorite color, I will have to say that
    purple tulips are in my top 3 <strong>favorite</strong> flowers.

<p>Tulips can be many different colors. The color purple to me signifies <i>royalty</i>. I believe we
    are a royal people. We must carry ourselves as such, and lead with kind and <b>servant</b> hearts.
