    <h>SUNFLOWERS ARE YELLOW</h>
<br>
<p>I love sunflowers, but not as much as roses. In my eyes, roses are the best of the best.
    There is no other way to describe them besides, beautiful, lovely and quite frankly, divine.
    Roses come in many different colors. Since pink is my favorite color, I will have to say that
    pink roses are definitely my <strong>favorite</strong>.

<h1>Let's talk about some of the places that sell beautiful flowers, <u>SUNFLOWERS</u>.</h1>
<br>
<p>Sunflowers are yellow. The color yellow to me signifies <i>joy</i>. Everyday I believe it is 
important to choose joy. We all have a choice of free will, and I always want to be on the side 
of being <b>grateful</b> and looking at life with a thankful heart.</p>
